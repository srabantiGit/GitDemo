/*
 * Pink highlighted words are keyword in java..these are java keyword..we cannot use them in our method..
 * 
 * All the control will start from the main method..control and execution will begin from main()..thats why we start our code writing 
 * in this main block..
 * 
 * Public static void main() is the heart of the java program..to execute a code we have to write it inside the main block outside that block
 * code will not work..
 * 
 * controls starts from the main method only and restricted to this main block.. 
 * 
 * class is the file where we actually write our code, the complete java program, it might be selenium or anything else..in the 
 * below example basic1 is the class name which is user defined..code execution is restricted within the main() method..
 * 
 * 
 * Defining an object for a class : instead of writing repetitive lines of codes we can write the common code in a class inside a method and
 * call that method from the parent/another class..we have to define/create object for the child class in the parent class  to call it from 
 * the parent class..
 * 
 * method m = new method(); -- here we are creating an object m for the method class..means if we want to access any particular method 
 * from the method class we can follow this syntax/formula //Classobject.methodname..here m is the Classobject..
 * 
 * If we will return void from the child class it will only show whatever is written in the System.out.println() but if we will return 
 * int or string then we need to mention that in place of void and parent class will receive that in response instead of 
 * what is written in System.out.println().  
 *
